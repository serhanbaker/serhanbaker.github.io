* __Istanbulite__ _(Uni Graduation Project)_: Istanbul travel guide with venue recommendations.
    * Venue properties represented with bit vectors (25 bits) and they’re stored in a graph database.
    * Wrote a matching algorithm to match venues with user’s priorities and preferences. Think OkCupid for venues (one sided).
    * When user _likes_ a venue, the application recommends related venues.
* __Pusher__ _(In Progress)_: An app that transfers textual data between nearby mac and iPhone. TODO: Find a better name
* __Connected__: Groups Facebook friends by colour with Strongly Connected Components algorithm.
* __Blink__: Twitter-like social platform to discuss projects inside office. Built with Python + Flask.
* __ToDo Heap__: Prioritized to-do list. Sorting and reminders are based on priority ranks of tasks. Think priority queue for todo lists.
