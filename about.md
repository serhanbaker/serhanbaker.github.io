title: About
---

I’m a software engineer in *Istanbul, Turkey*. I did my bachelor in **Computer Science** (graduated, 07/2013) and a **generalist programmer**.

I’m coming from a big data background, and have a passion for data in general, and also worked on machine learning and data visualization.

I love *minimalism*, *cooking*, *travelling* and *exploring new places*.
