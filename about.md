Iâ€™m a semi-fresh software engineer in Istanbul, Turkey (graduated from Computer Science, in summer 2013) who loves to tinker with many different aspects of programming. 

Besides my day job, you can find me programming a 2D platform game in C (in progress - still learning), prototyping some personal/useful apps (mostly framework-independent, and several web based apps), and building a repository of decent algorithms using Python (i.e. simple social media analysis, web scraper, a small scheduler, etc..), learning Haskell, or solving archived TopCoder contests.

I love minimalism, cooking, travelling and exploring new places.
